Procedural Instructions:

- Go through your life from the moment you graduated from school until now
- Identify every period in which you dedicated a significant amount of your time to a consistent goal
- Take these periods and classify them into 'Experience', 'Education' & 'Projects', where:
  - Experience: if the focus of this period was in **application** of knowledge or skills
  - Education: if the focus of this period was in **acquisition** of knowledge or skills
  - Project: if it was  an episode within a larger period dedicated either to **application** or **acquisition** of knowledge or skills; use this for poviding more detailed insights
- While you go through your vita, note down all skills acquired into the frontmatter, without rating the level just yet
- After you finished, subjectively rate your skills among each other:
  - The think you know best is 5 the thing you know least is 1.
  - Don't aim for an objective criterion, keep it subjective.
  - Your rating will have to be nordmed by the reader during interviews or via your overall vita.

Technical Instructions:

- Please conform rather strictly to the format, our parser is intricate and depends on the exact formatting.
- You can try for errors locally with `npm run dev`, otherwise our CI will complain if there's an issue
- Also check the final rendered CV before submitting the PR; create a GitHub issue, if you encounter any problem.

Localization Insttructions:

- When you finished your main language: copy your CV over with a suffix, e.g. `_fr.md` for french
- Then translate all items, including frontmatter values, with exception of (hard-coded keywords):
  - Headers: Experience | Education | Projects
  - Within Projects: List item prefixes 'Technologies:' & 'Link:' - all other free-form prefixes should be translated
